# Security and hosting

Magnusim currently runs as a trusted local application. Its API can read local
CAD files, write simulation projects, and start Python/WSL jobs with the server
user's permissions. It has no built-in account authentication or per-user
authorization. Bind it to loopback (the default).

For remote access, use an authenticated reverse proxy that preserves the
original Host header, restrict access to trusted users, and explicitly set
`MAGNUSIM_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to the comma-separated hostnames you serve. Host and
browser-origin validation are not authentication. Do not expose the raw Vite
server or unrestricted API as a public multi-user service.

## Plugins

A plugin is trusted code. Its Python runs with the same permissions as
Magnusim, and its page code runs inside the app. Install only plugins you trust,
the same as any program. Isolation between plugins and the core (separate worker
process, per-plugin data, disabling a plugin) protects Magnusim from plugin bugs
and crashes; it is not a defence against a deliberately malicious plugin.

Turning plugins on or off and reloading them changes what code the app runs, so
those requests are accepted only from a browser on the same PC talking to
Magnusim directly (a loopback Host and no `X-Forwarded-*` headers). Through a
reverse proxy or the public tunnel they answer 403 "Plugin management is only
available on this PC."

Keep projects, `.cache`, local preferences, environment files, keys, recordings,
and generated run reports out of source releases. `.gitignore` prevents new
tracking; it does not remove files from old commits. Review existing history
before pushing an existing repository publicly. A source zip made by
`pack-portable.ps1` excludes history and requires reviewed, committed source.

Report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainer through GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting facility when enabled. Do not include credentials or
private CAD/project files in a public issue.
